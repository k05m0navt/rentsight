# CI/CD Setup Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Errors (Next.js 15 Compatibility)

**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript and ESLint errors preventing successful builds.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Fixed ESLint flat config format (removed string config, kept only objects)
- ✅ Updated route handlers for Next.js 15's async `params` (now returns `Promise<{ id: string }>`)
- ✅ Updated page components for async `searchParams` (now returns `Promise<{...}>`)
- ✅ Fixed middleware to return both `supabase` client and response
- ✅ Replaced all `any` types with proper types (`unknown` with type guards, Prisma types)
- ✅ Fixed React Hook dependencies using `useCallback`
- ✅ Removed unused variables or prefixed with underscore

### 2. Pre-rendering Errors

**Problem**: Pages trying to pre-render at build time without Supabase credentials.

**Solution**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to pages that need runtime authentication:
- `/login` page
- `/signup` page  
- `/dashboard` page

This ensures these pages are rendered at request time, not build time.

### 3. Missing Test Infrastructure

**Problem**: CI was trying to run Playwright tests that didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created complete Playwright testing setup:
- ✅ Created `playwright.config.ts` with accessibility project
- ✅ Added `tests/accessibility.spec.ts` with Axe accessibility tests
- ✅ Added Playwright dependencies to `package.json`:
  - `@playwright/test`
  - `@axe-core/playwright`
- ✅ Added test scripts to `package.json`:
  - `test:e2e` - Run all tests
  - `test:e2e:ui` - Run with UI
  - `test:accessibility` - Run only accessibility tests
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude test artifacts
- ✅ Created `tests/README.md` with documentation

### 4. Lighthouse CI Configuration

**Problem**: Lighthouse CI had no URLs configured to test.

**Solution**: Added URLs to GitHub workflow:
```yaml
urls: |
  http://localhost:3000
  http://localhost:3000/login
  http://localhost:3000/signup
```

### 5. CI Workflow Improvements

**Updates to `.github/workflows/ui-ci.yml`**:
- ✅ Added Playwright browser installation step
- ✅ Added test report artifact uploads
- ✅ Configured Lighthouse with proper URLs

## Current Build Status

✅ **Build**: Passes successfully  
✅ **Linting**: Passes (only harmless warnings about intentionally unused variables)  
✅ **Type Checking**: Passes  
✅ **Tests**: Configured and ready to run  
✅ **CI/CD**: Ready for GitHub Actions

## Running Tests Locally

### Install Playwright browsers (first time only):
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Run tests:
```bash
npm run test:accessibility  # Run accessibility tests
npm run test:e2e           # Run all tests
npm run test:e2e:ui        # Run with interactive UI
```

### Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Pages Tested for Accessibility

- Homepage (`/`)
- Login page (`/login`)
- Signup page (`/signup`)

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Add more tests**: As you add new pages, create corresponding accessibility tests
2. **Test authenticated pages**: Add tests for `/dashboard` and other protected routes (requires test user setup)
3. **Performance budgets**: Adjust `.github/lighthouse-budget.json` based on your performance goals
4. **Environment variables**: Ensure Supabase credentials are only in runtime environment, not build time

## Build Output

All authentication-related pages are correctly marked as dynamic:
```
├ ƒ /dashboard      # Dynamic (authenticated)
├ ƒ /login          # Dynamic (checks existing auth)
└ ƒ /signup         # Dynamic (checks existing auth)
```

This ensures:
- Build succeeds without Supabase credentials
- Pages authenticate at runtime
- CI/CD pipeline works correctly
