# Using Tags

Tags are powerful tools for organizing and filtering your rental data. Learn how to make the most of them.

## What are Tags?

Tags are custom labels you create to categorize your rent and expense entries. Unlike properties (which represent physical locations), tags can represent any category you choose.

## Creating Tags

1. Go to the **Tags** page
2. Click **"Add Tag"** or **"Create Your First Tag"**
3. Enter a tag name
4. Choose a color for visual identification
5. Click **"Create"**

## Tag Examples

### By Property Feature
- "Oceanfront"
- "Pool"
- "Pet-Friendly"

### By Season
- "Summer 2025"
- "Winter Season"
- "Holiday Rentals"

### By Duration
- "Long-term"
- "Weekend"
- "Monthly"

### By Expense Category
- "Maintenance"
- "Utilities"
- "Repairs"
- "Cleaning"

## Applying Tags to Entries

When creating or editing rent/expense entries:
1. Scroll to the "Tags" section
2. Select one or more tags from your list
3. Tags are saved with the entry

You can add multiple tags to a single entry for multi-dimensional filtering.

## Filtering with Tags

Use tag filters to view specific subsets of your data:
1. On the Dashboard or Analytics pages
2. Select tags from the filter
3. View only entries with those tags
4. Combine multiple tags for refined filtering

## Tags + Properties

**Use Both Together!**

- **Property**: "Ocean View Apartment"
- **Tags**: "Summer 2025", "Long-term", "Verified Guest"

This combination gives you:
- Structured property-level reporting
- Flexible cross-property categorization
- Multi-dimensional analysis

## Best Practices

- **Create tags early** and use consistently
- **Use colors** to quickly identify tag categories
- **Keep names short** and descriptive
- **Create a tagging system** and stick to it
- **Review tags periodically** and merge duplicates
- **Use properties for location**, tags for everything else

## Managing Tags

### Editing Tags
Click the edit icon on any tag to:
- Update the name
- Change the color
- Save changes (affects all entries using this tag)

### Deleting Tags
- Click the delete icon
- Entries keep their data but lose the tag association
- Cannot be undone

## Tag Analytics

View tag-based insights on the Dashboard:
- Income by tag
- Expenses by tag
- Most/least used tags
- Tag combinations

This helps identify profitable categories and optimize your rental strategy.
