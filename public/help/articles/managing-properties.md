# Managing Properties

Properties are the foundation of organizing your rental business in RentSight. Learn how to effectively manage your property portfolio.

## Creating a Property

1. Navigate to **Properties** from the sidebar
2. Click **"Add Property"**
3. Fill in the property details:
   - **Name** (required): A unique identifier for the property
   - **Address**: Full address for reference
   - **Property Type**: Apartment, House, Condo, Townhouse, Duplex, or Other
   - **Start Date**: When you acquired or started renting
   - **Notes**: Any additional information

4. Click **"Create Property"**

## Editing Properties

To update property information:
1. Find the property in your list
2. Click the **Edit button** (pencil icon)
3. Update any fields
4. Click **"Update Property"**

Changes are reflected immediately across all associated entries.

## Deleting Properties

To remove a property:
1. Click the **Delete button** (trash icon) on the property card
2. Review the confirmation message (shows how many entries are associated)
3. Click **"Delete Property"** to confirm

**Important**: Associated rent and expense entries are NOT deleted. They simply lose their property association and can still be accessed through tags or the main entry lists.

## Property Features

### Search

Use the search bar to quickly find properties by name. The search is case-insensitive and searches as you type.

### Property Stats

Each property card shows:
- **Rent entries count** - Total number of rental periods recorded
- **Expense entries count** - Total number of expenses tracked
- These stats help you understand which properties have the most activity

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive names** that you'll recognize later
- **Include addresses** for properties in multiple locations
- **Set the start date** to track property age and depreciation
- **Use notes** for important details like unit numbers, special features, or reminders
- **Review property stats regularly** to identify your most/least profitable properties

## Properties vs Tags

- **Properties** = Structured data about physical locations
- **Tags** = Flexible labels for additional categorization

Use both together for maximum organization power!
