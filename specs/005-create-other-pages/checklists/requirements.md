# Specification Quality Checklist: Create other pages

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Items Pass

**Content Quality**: All sections focus on user value without implementation details, written for non-technical stakeholders.

**Requirement Completeness**: All requirements are testable, unambiguous, and clearly defined. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Edge cases identified and scope clearly bounded.

**Feature Readiness**: All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria. User scenarios cover primary flows comprehensively.

### Resolved Clarifications

All 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved:

1. **Property Management Approach**: Formal property management with dedicated page and entity (Option A)
2. **Property-Entry Association**: Properties work alongside tags as separate fields (Option B)
3. **Property Attributes**: Standard fields - name, address, property type, purchase/start date, notes (Option B)

## Notes

- **Specification Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for planning phase
- **Scope**: Five new pages (Settings, Properties, Help, Reports, About)
- **Priority**: P1 pages (Settings, Properties) are essential; P2-P3 pages add value but can be deferred
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan
- **Key Decision**: Property management will be implemented as a formal entity alongside existing tags, providing structured organization while maintaining categorization flexibility
