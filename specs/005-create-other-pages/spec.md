# Feature Specification: Create other pages

**Feature Branch**: `005-create-other-pages`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create other pages"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access User Settings and Profile (Priority: P1)

As a renter, I want to access a settings page where I can manage my account information, preferences, and application settings so that I can customize my experience and maintain my account.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user account management and personalization. Users need to update their profile, change passwords, and configure application preferences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to settings, updating profile information, and verifying changes persist across sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to the settings page, **Then** I see my current profile information and application preferences.
2. **Given** I am on the settings page, **When** I update my profile information (name, email) and save, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected throughout the application.
3. **Given** I am on the settings page, **When** I change my password and save, **Then** I can log in with the new password.
4. **Given** I am on the settings page, **When** I update my preferences (currency, date format, language), **Then** the application reflects these preferences.

### User Story 2 - Manage Properties/Listings (Priority: P1)

As a renter, I want to view and manage my rental properties in a dedicated page so that I can organize my rental business and associate entries with specific properties.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality for organizing rental business with structured property data. Formal property management provides dedicated fields for property-specific information (address, type, dates) while maintaining the flexibility of tags for additional categorization. This structured approach enables better portfolio management and property-specific reporting.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding, editing, and deleting property entries, then verifying properties can be associated with rent/expense entries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to the properties page, **Then** I see a list of all my rental properties.
2. **Given** I am on the properties page, **When** I add a new property with details (name, address, type), **Then** the property is saved and appears in my list.
3. **Given** I am viewing my properties, **When** I edit a property's details, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected in associated entries.
4. **Given** I am viewing my properties, **When** I delete a property, **Then** I am asked to confirm and the property is removed (with handling for associated entries).
5. **Given** I have properties with associated rent/expense entries, **When** I navigate to the dashboard, **Then** I can filter analytics by property to see property-specific performance.

### User Story 3 - Access Help and Documentation (Priority: P2)

As a renter, I want to access a help page with documentation, FAQs, and support contact information so that I can learn how to use the application and get help when needed.

**Why this priority**: Improves user onboarding and reduces support burden by providing self-service help resources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the help page and verifying all documentation sections are accessible and readable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to the help page, **Then** I see documentation sections, FAQs, and support contact options.
2. **Given** I am on the help page, **When** I search for a topic, **Then** relevant help articles are displayed.
3. **Given** I am on the help page, **When** I click a FAQ question, **Then** the answer expands and is clearly visible.

### User Story 4 - View Detailed Reports (Priority: P2)

As a renter, I want to access a dedicated reports page where I can generate and view detailed historical reports with advanced filtering options so that I can analyze trends and prepare for tax season.

**Why this priority**: Extends the analytics dashboard with more detailed reporting capabilities for power users and tax preparation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating various reports with different filters and date ranges, verifying data accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to the reports page, **Then** I see options to generate various types of reports (income summary, expense breakdown, tax report).
2. **Given** I am on the reports page, **When** I select a date range and filters, **Then** the report is generated showing relevant data.
3. **Given** I am viewing a generated report, **When** I choose to export it, **Then** the report is downloaded in my selected format (PDF, CSV, Excel).
4. **Given** I am on the reports page, **When** I select a tax report, **Then** I see income and expenses formatted for tax preparation.

### User Story 5 - View About/Information Page (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to view an about page with information about the application, version, terms of service, and privacy policy so that I understand the application and legal terms.

**Why this priority**: Important for transparency and legal compliance, but lower priority than functional pages.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the about page and verifying all information is displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the application, **When** I navigate to the about page, **Then** I see application information, version number, and links to legal documents.
2. **Given** I am on the about page, **When** I click on terms of service or privacy policy, **Then** the respective document is displayed.

### Edge Cases

- **Unsaved Changes**: What happens when a user navigates away from settings with unsaved changes? The system should warn the user and provide options to save or discard changes.
- **Invalid Settings**: How does the system handle invalid input in settings (e.g., invalid email format, weak password)? The system should display clear validation errors.
- **Empty States**: What happens when the properties page has no properties or reports page has no data? The system should display helpful empty states with actions to get started.
- **Large Property Lists**: How does the system handle users with many properties (1000+)? The system should implement pagination or virtualization for performance (see SC-004 for specific performance targets).
- **Session Timeout**: What happens when a user's session expires while on these pages? The system should redirect to login with a message to preserve the intended destination.
