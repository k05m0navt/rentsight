## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only - Both P1)

**Recommended initial scope**:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T017) - **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Settings (T018-T027)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Properties (T028-T039)
5. Complete Phase 8: Integration (T068-T073)
6. Complete Phase 9: Polish (T074-T090)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 and US2 independently and together
8. Deploy MVP

**Why this MVP?**
- Both US1 and US2 are P1 (highest priority)
- Settings provides essential account management
- Properties provides core new functionality
- Together they deliver significant value
- Can be demoed and deployed independently
- P2 and P3 stories can follow incrementally

### Incremental Delivery

**After MVP deployment**:

1. Add User Story 3 (Help) - Deploy
2. Add User Story 4 (Reports) - Deploy
3. Add User Story 5 (About) - Deploy

Each story adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 5 developers:

1. **Week 1**: Entire team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T017)
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational is done, split:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Settings) - T018-T027
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Properties) - T028-T039
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Help) - T040-T050
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Reports) - T051-T062
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (About) - T063-T067
3. **Week 4**: Team converges for Integration + Polish (T068-T090)

### Solo Developer Strategy

**Recommended order**:

1. Week 1: Setup + Foundational (T001-T017)

**By Phase:**
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 14 tasks (blocking) - includes T009a for User.name field
- Phase 3 (US1 - Settings): 10 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Properties): 12 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Help): 11 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Reports): 12 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5 - About): 5 tasks
- Phase 8 (Integration): 9 tasks - includes T071a-T071c for property filtering in dashboard
- Phase 9 (Polish): 27 tasks - includes preference integration (T091-T096), unsaved changes warnings, performance optimizations

**By User Story:**
- US1 (Settings): 16 tasks - includes 6 new preference integration tasks (T091-T096)
- US2 (Properties): 15 tasks - includes property filtering in dashboard (T071a-T071c), unsaved changes warning (T074a)
- US3 (Help): 13 tasks - includes performance optimization (T078a)
- US4 (Reports): 14 tasks - includes unsaved changes warning (T074b), performance optimization (T078b)
- US5 (About): 6 tasks - includes legal review checkpoint (T085a)
- Shared/Infrastructure: 40 tasks

**Parallelization:**
- 60 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- 44 tasks must run sequentially

**MVP Scope (US1 + US2 + Infrastructure):**
- 62 tasks total - includes foundational tasks, Settings, Properties, Integration (with property filtering), and essential Polish tasks
- Estimated: 2-4 weeks for solo developer
- Estimated: 1-2 weeks for team of 3

**Full Feature (All 5 User Stories):**
- 104 tasks total
- Estimated: 5-7 weeks for solo developer
- Estimated: 3-4 weeks for team of 5

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1-US5 or US-ALL)
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) is critical path - must complete before any user story
- Stop at checkpoints to validate stories independently
- Tests are included throughout (E2E, accessibility, visual regression, performance)
- Database migration is one-way (can't easily roll back once in production)
- Property-entry associations are optional and backward compatible
- All new pages follow existing design system for consistency

## Quick Reference

**Start here (MVP)**:
1. T001-T017: Setup + Foundational (includes T009a for User.name field)
2. T018-T027: Settings (US1)
3. T028-T039: Properties (US2)
4. T068-T071c: Integration (includes property filtering in dashboard)
5. T074-T096: Essential Polish (includes preference integration T091-T096)

**Critical path**: Phase 2 Foundational (T005-T017) blocks all user stories

**New tasks for critical features**:
- T009a: User name field in database
- T071a-T071c: Property filtering in dashboard analytics
- T074a-T074b: Unsaved changes warnings for Properties and Reports
- T078a-T078b: Performance optimizations for Help and Reports
- T085a: Legal review checkpoint
- T091-T096: User preference integration across application

**Independent stories**: US1, US2, US3, US5 are fully independent
**Soft dependency**: US4 (Reports) can use PropertySelector from US2 for property filtering
