# Tasks: Visual Design System Adoption from AI Hiring SaaS CRM

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-as-a-developer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Visual regression testing is explicitly requested in the feature specification for validating design compliance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths based on existing Next.js application structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and visual testing infrastructure

- [X] T001 Create visual regression testing structure in tests/visual/
- [X] T002 [P] Setup Playwright configuration for visual testing in playwright.config.ts
- [X] T003 [P] Create screenshot baseline directory structure in tests/__screenshots__/
- [X] T004 [P] Initialize design token documentation structure in docs/design-system/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core design system infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Create design token system in src/lib/design-tokens.ts with color palette from AI Hiring SaaS CRM design reference

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Visual Design System Analysis (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Identify and document all visual design elements from the AI Hiring SaaS CRM design that can be adopted for the rental analytics app

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by comparing current visual styling against design reference and documenting specific visual elements that can be adopted (colors, typography, spacing, component styles)

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Implementation (Phase 6)**: Depends on all analysis user stories (US1, US2, US3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on implementation phase completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent analysis of component styling
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent analysis of layout and spacing

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Analysis documentation before implementation tasks
- Component updates before validation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Analysis tasks within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Implementation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel across different components

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create visual regression test for color palette analysis in tests/visual/color-palette.spec.ts"
Task: "Create visual regression test for typography analysis in tests/visual/typography.spec.ts"
Task: "Create visual regression test for spacing analysis in tests/visual/spacing.spec.ts"

# Launch all analysis tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create design analysis report in docs/design-system/analysis-report.md"
Task: "Create component styling analysis in docs/design-system/component-analysis.md"
Task: "Create typography analysis in docs/design-system/typography-analysis.md"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Visual Design System Analysis)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Analysis MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Component Analysis!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Layout Analysis!)
5. Add Implementation Phase ‚Üí Complete Visual Redesign
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Visual Design System Analysis)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Component Styling Analysis)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Layout and Spacing Analysis)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Implementation phase can proceed with multiple developers working on different components in parallel

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Visual regression testing is required for all component updates
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing component APIs
- Focus on visual design adoption without changing core functionality
