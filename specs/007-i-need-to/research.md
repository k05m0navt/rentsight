# Research: Enhanced Platform Support with Russian Markets

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Feature**: Enhanced Platform Support with Russian Markets

## Research Findings

### Russian Rental Platforms

**Decision**: Include Avito, Cian, Sutochno.ru, Domclick, Yandex.Realty, and 3 additional platforms  
**Rationale**: These are the most popular rental platforms in the Russian market based on market research and user requirements  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Including only the 3 mentioned platforms (insufficient coverage)
- Including 20+ platforms (too complex for initial implementation)

### Custom Platform Storage Strategy

**Decision**: User-specific custom platforms stored in separate database table  
**Rationale**: Maintains data privacy and allows users to manage their own platform lists without affecting others  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Global custom platforms (privacy concerns)
- JSON storage in user preferences (limited querying capabilities)

### Platform Management Interface

**Decision**: Modal/popup interface accessible from rent entry form  
**Rationale**: Provides easy access without navigation complexity, maintains context within the form workflow  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Separate dedicated page (adds navigation complexity)
- Inline management within dropdown (limited space for complex operations)

### Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Client-side validation with error messages that preserve user input  
**Rationale**: Provides immediate feedback while allowing users to correct mistakes without losing their work  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Server-side only validation (poor user experience)
- Auto-correction (may change user intent)

### Backward Compatibility

**Decision**: Maintain existing "Other" platform entries as-is, add new custom platform functionality  
**Rationale**: Ensures no data loss for existing users while providing enhanced functionality for new entries  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Migrate existing "Other" entries to custom platforms (risky data transformation)
- Remove "Other" option entirely (breaking change)

## Technical Decisions

### Database Schema

**Decision**: Add CustomPlatform table with user_id foreign key  
**Rationale**: Enables user-specific platform management with proper relational integrity  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Extend existing Platform table (mixing global and user-specific data)
- Use JSON field in UserPreferences (limited querying and validation)

### API Design

**Decision**: RESTful API endpoints for platform CRUD operations  
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing API patterns, simple to implement and test  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- GraphQL (overkill for simple CRUD operations)
- Server actions only (limited reusability)

### UI Component Architecture

**Decision**: Extend existing form components with new platform management features  
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with current UI patterns, leverages existing validation and state management  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Complete form rewrite (unnecessary complexity)
- Separate form for platform management (fragmented user experience)
