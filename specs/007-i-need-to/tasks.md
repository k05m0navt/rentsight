# Implementation Tasks: Enhanced Platform Support with Russian Markets

**Branch**: `007-i-need-to` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-i-need-to/spec.md`

## Summary

Replace current hardcoded platform options with Russian rental platforms (Avito, Cian, Sutochno.ru) and enable custom platform entry with user-specific management. This addresses the limitation where users can only select from 4 generic options and cannot specify custom platform names when selecting "Other".

**Total Tasks**: 55 tasks (47 original + 8 additional coverage tasks)

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Russian Platform Selection) - provides immediate value for Russian users  
**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story is independently testable and deployable  
**Parallel Development**: Database and API tasks can be developed in parallel with UI components

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Initialize project structure and dependencies for platform management feature

- [x] T001 Initialize platform management feature branch from main
- [x] T002 [P] Create platform-specific component directory structure in `src/app/components/platform/`
- [x] T003 [P] Create platform API routes directory structure in `src/app/api/platforms/`
- [x] T004 [P] Update TypeScript types for platform management in `src/types/regional.ts`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Create CustomPlatform database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [x] T006 [P] Add custom_platform_name column to RentEntry table in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [x] T007 [P] Generate and run Prisma migration for CustomPlatform table
- [x] T008 [P] Update regional-config.ts with Russian platforms (completely replace current 4 options with 8+ Russian platforms)
- [x] T009 [P] Create platform validation schemas in `src/lib/validations.ts`
- [x] T010 Create platform service layer in `src/lib/services/platformService.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Russian Platform Selection (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Russian property managers can select from popular Russian rental platforms when creating rent entries

**Independent Test**: Create a rent entry and verify that Russian platforms appear in the platform dropdown and can be selected successfully

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T011 [US1] Update rent-entry-form.tsx to use Russian platforms from regional-config.ts
- [x] T012 [US1] Replace hardcoded platformOptions array with dynamic platform loading
- [x] T013 [US1] Update platform dropdown to display Russian platform names correctly
- [x] T014 [US1] Ensure platform selection saves correctly to database
- [x] T015 [US1] Update reports/analytics to display Russian platform names
- [x] T016 [US1] Test platform selection performance (must load within 2 seconds)
- [x] T016a [US1] Add performance monitoring for platform dropdown loading time

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Custom Platform Entry (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can add custom platform names when "Other" option is selected, allowing them to specify exactly which platform they used

**Independent Test**: Select "Other" platform option and verify that a text input appears allowing custom platform name entry

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T017 [US2] Create CustomPlatform API endpoints in `src/app/api/platforms/custom/route.ts`
- [x] T018 [US2] Create CustomPlatform API endpoints in `src/app/api/platforms/custom/[id]/route.ts`
- [x] T019 [US2] Create CustomPlatform API endpoints in `src/app/api/platforms/custom/[id]/usage/route.ts`
- [x] T020 [US2] Update rent-entry-form.tsx to show text input when "Other" is selected
- [x] T021 [US2] Add custom platform name validation (2-100 characters, error preservation)
- [x] T021a [US2] Test international character support in custom platform names
- [x] T022 [US2] Implement custom platform creation logic in form submission
- [x] T023 [US2] Update platform dropdown to include user's custom platforms

- [x] T026 [US2] Test custom platform persistence and retrieval

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 2 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Platform Management (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can manage their custom platforms through a dedicated interface, allowing them to edit, delete, or organize their frequently used platforms

**Independent Test**: Access platform management interface and perform CRUD operations on custom platforms

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T027 [US3] Create PlatformManagementModal component in `src/app/components/platform/PlatformManagementModal.tsx`
- [x] T028 [US3] Create CustomPlatformList component in `src/app/components/platform/CustomPlatformList.tsx`
- [x] T029 [US3] Create CustomPlatformForm component in `src/app/components/platform/CustomPlatformForm.tsx`
- [x] T030 [US3] Add platform management button to rent-entry-form.tsx

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
1. **User Story 1** (P1) - Can be implemented immediately after Phase 2
2. **User Story 2** (P2) - Depends on User Story 1 for platform dropdown integration
3. **User Story 3** (P3) - Depends on User Story 2 for custom platform data

### Critical Path
- **T005 ‚Üí T007**: Database schema must be complete before any user story implementation
- **T008 ‚Üí T011**: Russian platforms must be configured before form updates
- **T017-T019 ‚Üí T020-T026**: Custom platform API must be complete before form integration
- **T027-T037**: Platform management depends on custom platform functionality

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **SC-004**: Platform management operations complete successfully for 99% of user actions (T037)
- **SC-005**: System maintains data integrity with zero data loss when managing custom platforms (T045)

## Task Summary
