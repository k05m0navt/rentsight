# Specification Quality Checklist: Modern responsive design and dark mode

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: `../spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification


## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Results

- Passing items: content quality, requirements completeness (after clarifications), feature readiness (after clarifications).
- Remaining action: usability testing to verify measurable outcomes; this is an external validation step and not a spec issue.

## Clarification Log

 - 2025-10-09: Q1 - Where should authenticated users' theme preference be stored? → A: Store client-side only (local storage/cookie; no server changes). Spec updated to reflect client-side-only persistence.
 - 2025-10-09: Q2 - What contrast standard should we target for primary text and controls? → A: WCAG AA contrast ratio for normal text (4.5:1). Spec updated to require WCAG AA targets in FR-006 and SC-004.
 - 2025-10-09: Q3 - What performance target should we set for page load experience on mobile? → A: Perceived load 'instant' for primary content (<=500ms). Spec updated to add SC-005 and performance target in Assumptions.
 - 2025-10-09: Q4 - Should keyboard accessibility (tab order and visible focus) be required for all interactive controls? → A: Require full keyboard operability and visible focus for all interactive controls. Spec updated to add FR-010 and SC-006.
