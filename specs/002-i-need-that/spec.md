# Feature Specification: Modern responsive design and dark mode

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-need-that`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I need that the application have modern design, with responsive and ready for mobiles. Also, it need to have dark mode."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09

- Q: Where should authenticated users' theme preference be stored? → A: Store client-side only (browser `localStorage`). Cookie fallback was considered and is intentionally NOT implemented in this iteration.
- Q: What contrast standard should we target for primary text and controls? → A: WCAG AA contrast ratio for normal text (4.5:1)
- Q: What performance target should we set for page load experience on mobile? → A: Perceived load 'instant' for primary content (<=500ms)
- Q: Should keyboard accessibility (tab order and visible focus) be required for all interactive controls? → A: Require full keyboard operability and visible focus for all interactive controls

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Use app comfortably on any device (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the application to present a modern, touch-friendly layout so I can complete core tasks on mobile and desktop without layout issues.

**Why this priority**: Mobile accessibility and usability affect nearly all users; delivering a responsive modern UI unlocks the app's core value on phones where many users will manage properties and expenses.

**Independent Test**: Manually verify core flows on viewport widths defined in `Definitions` (below); layout should remain usable and all primary actions accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on a small-screen device, **When** they open a primary page, **Then** the page meets `FR-004` (renders correctly without overlapping or clipping and primary actions reachable).
2. **Given** the user is on a desktop, **When** they open the same primary page, **Then** the layout uses available space to surface key information without overlapping or truncation.

### User Story 2 - Dark mode support with easy toggle (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want a visually consistent dark theme and an easy way to switch between light and dark so I can use the app comfortably in low-light conditions.

**Why this priority**: Dark mode is a widely expected UX feature that improves comfort and accessibility for users in different lighting conditions.

**Independent Test**: Toggle the theme in the UI and confirm colors, icons, and text remain legible; verify the chosen theme persists across page loads.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user toggles dark mode, **When** they navigate to other pages or reload, **Then** the selected theme remains active.

---

### User Story 3 - Accessibility and visual polish (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want readable typography, sufficient contrast, and accessible controls so that the app feels polished and usable for people with different needs.

**Why this priority**: Polished visuals and baseline accessibility increase trust and lower support requests.

**Independent Test**: Run basic manual accessibility checks (text sizes, focus states, color contrast sampling) on representative pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a primary page (dashboard, rent entry, expense entry), **When** a user inspects text and control contrast, **Then** all primary controls and text meet common accessibility contrast expectations (e.g., readable without strain).

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- Extremely small screens (older phones) where the viewport width is < 360px: ensure critical actions remain accessible via stacked layouts and clear CTAs.
- Users with very large font settings or browser zoom: ensure layouts do not break and content remains reachable (stacking overflows into vertical scroll instead of clipping).
- Color-blindness and reduced-contrast mode: ensure information conveyed by color has an alternative (iconography, labels).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The UI MUST adapt layout and navigation for small (<= 768px), medium, and large viewports so that primary tasks require no horizontal scrolling and primary actions are reachable within 2 taps/clicks on mobile.
- **FR-002**: The application MUST provide a dark theme and a light theme with a visible toggle in the global UI allowing users to switch themes at any time.
-- **FR-003**: The chosen theme MUST persist across page reloads and navigation within the user's browser by using client-side `localStorage`. The feature does not require server-side persistence and will not sync preferences across different devices.
- **FR-004**: All primary pages (dashboard, rent entry, expense entry, tag manager) MUST render correctly on mobile and desktop without overlapping or clipping of content.
- **FR-005**: Typography scale and spacing MUST be adjusted to maintain readability on small screens (minimum tappable control size conventions applied to primary actions).
- **FR-006**: Visual styles MUST meet WCAG AA contrast requirements for normal text (minimum 4.5:1) and WCAG AA for large text (minimum 3:1) for primary text and interactive controls. These targets are testable during accessibility QA.
- **FR-007**: Icons and imagery used in the UI MUST have suitable variants or treatments for dark mode to maintain visibility.

- **FR-010**: All interactive controls (buttons, links, form fields, menus) MUST be operable via keyboard and present a visible focus state when focused. Keyboard tab order must follow a logical reading order and not trap focus.

*Unclear / scope-limiting items*:

-- **FR-008**: The set of pages to be restyled is the entire application. All existing screens and routes will receive the design modernization and responsive updates in this iteration.
-- **FR-009**: Default theme behaviour: The application SHOULD default to the user's system color-scheme when first visited. Users can override via the theme toggle; the selection persists client-side as described in FR-003.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-- **ThemePreference**: Represents a user's visual preference. Key attributes: preference value (light/dark/system), persistence scope (client-side local storage). This feature does not create or require a server-side profile field.
- **ViewportProfile**: (conceptual) Represents viewport categories used by layout rules (mobile/tablet/desktop). This is a design-time concept for acceptance testing rather than a persisted data entity.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: On a representative set of core pages, 95% of layouts render without horizontal scrolling and primary actions are reachable within two taps on viewport widths <= 768px.
- **SC-002**: Dark mode selection persists in the same browser across page reloads for 99% of sessions (measured by checking the stored preference in `localStorage` during QA testing).
- **SC-003**: In usability testing with 20 participants, at least 85% rate the UI as "modern and usable" on mobile and desktop.
- **SC-004**: Accessibility checks for primary pages pass WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text) for 100% of tested pages in scope.
- **SC-005**: Primary content (above-the-fold key UI) should be perceivable to users within 500ms on representative mobile devices (perceived load <= 500ms).
- **SC-006**: 100% of primary interactive controls on tested pages must be reachable and operable via keyboard and show a visible focus indicator during keyboard navigation.


## Definitions

- **Primary pages**: Dashboard, Rent entry form, Expense entry form, Tag manager.
- **Primary content**: Above-the-fold main panel on a primary page (the section users interact with first).

## Assumptions

- Default scope includes the entire application: all existing screens and routes will receive the design modernization and responsive updates (see FR-008).
- For persistence: theme preference will be stored client-side using the browser `localStorage` for all users. No server-side profile changes are required for theme persistence.
- Accessibility target: Visual styles will target WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text) as a minimum acceptance threshold.
- Performance target: Primary pages should aim for perceived load of primary content <= 500ms on representative mobile devices; full-page readiness may be longer but should avoid blocking primary actions.

- Keyboard accessibility target: All interactive controls will be keyboard-operable with visible focus states; tab order follows logical reading order.

## Notes

- This specification focuses on user-visible behavior and acceptance criteria. It intentionally avoids implementation details such as the storage mechanism, CSS frameworks, or client-side storage APIs.
