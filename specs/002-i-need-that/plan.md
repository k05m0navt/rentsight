# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deliver a modern, responsive UI across the entire application with dark mode support, client-side theme persistence (`localStorage`), WCAG AA contrast targets, keyboard accessibility, and perceived mobile load targets. Use Aceternity UI components where available; fall back to `shadcn/ui` if inaccessible. Styling via Tailwind CSS and CSS variables for semantic tokens.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Next.js project present)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS, Aceternity UI (preferred), `shadcn/ui` (fallback)  
**Storage**: N/A (theme stored in browser `localStorage`)  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e/accessibility) - confirmed
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop and mobile browsers)  
**Project Type**: Frontend changes to existing Next.js app  
**Performance Goals**: Perceived primary content load <= 500ms on representative mobile devices  
**Constraints**: No server-side persistence for theme; must meet WCAG AA contrast and keyboard accessibility targets  
**Scale/Scope**: Entire application UI and screens

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

# [REMOVE IF UNUSED] Option 2: Web application (when "frontend" + "backend" detected)

# [REMOVE IF UNUSED] Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure: feature modules, UI flows, platform tests]
```

**Structure Decision**: Use the existing Next.js app under `src/app`. Place new components under `src/components/` and styles/tokens under `src/styles/`.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
