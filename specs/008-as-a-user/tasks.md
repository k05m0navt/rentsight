# Tasks: Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-as-a-user/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project structure per plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic PWA structure

- [x] T001 [P] Create PWA icon assets in public/icons/ directory
- [x] T002 [P] Install PWA dependencies: next-pwa, workbox-webpack-plugin, @types/serviceworker
- [x] T003 [P] Configure Next.js for PWA in next.config.ts with next-pwa wrapper
- [x] T004 [P] Create PWA type definitions in src/types/pwa.ts
- [x] T005 [P] Create PWA utilities in src/lib/pwa.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core PWA infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Create web app manifest in public/manifest.json with proper metadata and icons
- [x] T007 [P] Configure service worker caching strategies in next.config.ts
- [x] T008 [P] Update root layout in src/app/layout.tsx with PWA metadata and viewport settings
- [x] T009 [P] Create PWA hook in src/hooks/usePWA.ts for app state management
- [x] T010 Setup environment variables for PWA configuration in .env.local

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Performance optimization affects all stories
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Push notifications enhance all stories

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create install prompt component in src/components/InstallPrompt.tsx"
Task: "Create install button component in src/components/InstallButton.tsx"
Task: "Create install service in src/lib/installService.ts"

# Launch all foundational tasks together:
Task: "Create PWA icon assets in public/icons/ directory"
Task: "Install PWA dependencies: next-pwa, workbox-webpack-plugin, @types/serviceworker"
Task: "Configure Next.js for PWA in next.config.ts with next-pwa wrapper"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Install App)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Offline Access)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Performance)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Push Notifications)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify PWA functionality at each checkpoint
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
