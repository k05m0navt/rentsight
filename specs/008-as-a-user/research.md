# Research: Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

**Feature**: 008-as-a-user  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Purpose**: Technical decisions and implementation approach for PWA conversion

## PWA Library Selection

**Decision**: Use `next-pwa` with Workbox integration

**Rationale**: 
- Seamless integration with Next.js 15.5.4
- Automatic service worker generation and management
- Built-in caching strategies and offline support
- Production-ready with active maintenance
- Minimal configuration required for basic PWA functionality

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual service worker implementation: Too complex and error-prone
- `workbox-webpack-plugin` standalone: Requires more configuration
- `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`: Less mature and fewer features

## Service Worker Strategy

**Decision**: Implement cache-first strategy for static assets, network-first for API calls

**Rationale**:
- Cache-first ensures fast loading of app shell and static content
- Network-first for API calls ensures fresh data when online
- Fallback to cached data when offline for core functionality
- Background sync for offline changes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Stale-while-revalidate: Good for performance but complex implementation
- Network-only: Would break offline functionality requirement

## Offline Data Storage

**Decision**: Use IndexedDB with Dexie.js wrapper for offline data persistence

**Rationale**:
- IndexedDB provides robust offline storage for complex data
- Dexie.js simplifies IndexedDB API and provides better TypeScript support
- Supports large amounts of data with good performance
- Automatic indexing and querying capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- localStorage: Limited storage capacity and synchronous API
- Cache API: Better for HTTP responses, not structured data
- WebSQL: Deprecated standard

## Push Notification Implementation

**Decision**: Use Web Push Protocol with VAPID keys and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

**Rationale**:
- Web Push is the standard for web push notifications
- FCM provides reliable delivery and cross-browser support
- VAPID keys ensure secure push message delivery
- Works across all major browsers and platforms

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-sent events: Limited to same-origin, no offline delivery
- WebSockets: Complex implementation, no offline capability
- Email notifications: Different user experience, not real-time

## App Manifest Configuration

**Decision**: Standalone display mode with custom theme colors and comprehensive icon set

**Rationale**:
- Standalone mode provides native app-like experience
- Custom theme colors match existing design system
- Multiple icon sizes ensure compatibility across all devices
- Proper start URL and scope configuration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Minimalist manifest: Would reduce installability
- Fullscreen mode: Too restrictive for web app usage

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Implement lazy loading, code splitting, and optimized caching strategies

**Rationale**:
- Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- Code splitting improves loading performance
- Optimized caching ensures fast subsequent visits
- Meets performance targets (3s initial, 1s cached)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Aggressive caching: Risk of stale content
- No caching: Would not meet performance requirements

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Extend existing Playwright test suite with PWA-specific tests

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing testing infrastructure
- Playwright supports PWA testing including service worker and manifest
- Can test installation, offline functionality, and push notifications
- Maintains consistency with current testing approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate PWA testing framework: Additional complexity
- Manual testing only: Insufficient coverage for production

## Security Considerations

**Decision**: Implement HTTPS enforcement, secure service worker, and proper CSP headers

**Rationale**:
- HTTPS required for PWA functionality and service workers
- Secure service worker prevents malicious code injection
- CSP headers protect against XSS attacks
- Follows PWA security best practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- HTTP-only implementation: Would not work as PWA
- Minimal security: Risk of vulnerabilities

## Browser Compatibility

**Decision**: Target modern browsers with PWA support (Chrome 68+, Safari 11.1+, Firefox 68+)

**Rationale**:
- Covers 95%+ of current browser usage
- Ensures core PWA features are available
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Focuses on quality over universal compatibility

**Alternatives considered**:
- Legacy browser support: Would limit PWA capabilities
- Latest browsers only: Would exclude too many users

## Implementation Phases

**Decision**: Implement in 3 phases: Core PWA → Offline Support → Push Notifications

**Rationale**:
- Phased approach reduces risk and allows for incremental testing
- Core PWA provides immediate value (installation, performance)
- Offline support adds significant user value
- Push notifications enhance engagement but are lower priority

**Alternatives considered**:
- All features at once: Higher risk of issues
- Single feature per phase: Too slow delivery of value
