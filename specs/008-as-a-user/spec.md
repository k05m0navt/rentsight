# Feature Specification: Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Feature Branch**: `008-as-a-user`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As a user, I want to have this web app as PWA"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Install App on Device (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to install the RentSight web app on my mobile device or desktop so that I can access it like a native app without needing to open a browser.

**Why this priority**: Core PWA functionality - the primary value proposition is making the web app feel and behave like a native application. This is the foundation that enables all other PWA benefits.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the app in a supported browser and verifying the install prompt appears and successfully installs the app to the device home screen/app drawer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm using Chrome, Edge, or Safari on mobile/desktop, **When** I visit the RentSight web app, **Then** I see an install prompt or can access install option in browser menu
2. **Given** I click install, **When** the installation completes, **Then** the app appears on my device home screen/app drawer with proper icon and name
3. **Given** I launch the installed app, **When** it opens, **Then** it runs in standalone mode without browser UI elements

### User Story 2 - Offline Access to Core Features (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to access basic app functionality when I have poor or no internet connection so that I can continue working with my rental data.

**Why this priority**: Offline capability is a key differentiator for PWAs and provides significant user value, especially for property management tasks that may be performed in areas with unreliable connectivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by disconnecting from internet and verifying that previously loaded data remains accessible and basic app functions work without network connectivity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have loaded the app with my rental data, **When** I lose internet connection, **Then** I can still view my properties, rent entries, and expense data
2. **Given** I'm offline, **When** I make changes to data, **Then** changes are stored locally and synced when connection is restored
3. **Given** I'm offline, **When** I try to access features requiring network, **Then** I see clear messaging about offline status and what's available

### User Story 3 - Fast App Loading and Performance (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want the app to load quickly and respond instantly to my interactions, especially on subsequent visits.

**Why this priority**: Performance is critical for user experience and app adoption. Fast loading times and responsive interactions make the app feel native and professional.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring app load times, interaction responsiveness, and comparing performance metrics before and after PWA implementation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I visit the app for the first time, **When** it loads, **Then** it displays content within 3 seconds on a 3G connection
2. **Given** I return to the app after initial visit, **When** I open it, **Then** it loads from cache and displays content within 1 second
3. **Given** I interact with buttons, forms, or navigation, **When** I click/tap, **Then** the app responds immediately without noticeable delay

### User Story 4 - Push Notifications for Important Updates (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to receive notifications about important rental property updates even when the app is closed so that I don't miss critical information.

**Why this priority**: Push notifications enhance user engagement and provide value for time-sensitive rental management tasks, but are secondary to core PWA functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by subscribing to notifications and verifying that relevant updates trigger appropriate push notifications when the app is not active.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have granted notification permissions, **When** there are new rent payments or overdue accounts, **Then** I receive a push notification
2. **Given** I have notifications enabled, **When** I click on a notification, **Then** the app opens to the relevant section
3. **Given** I want to manage notifications, **When** I access settings, **Then** I can enable/disable different types of notifications

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the app is installed but the manifest file is corrupted or missing?
- How does the system handle offline data when storage quota is exceeded?
- What occurs when push notification permissions are denied or revoked?
- How does the app behave when service worker registration fails?
- What happens when the app is launched from a notification but the service worker is not active?
