# Implementation Plan: Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Branch**: `008-as-a-user` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-as-a-user/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Convert the existing RentSight Next.js web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities, app installation, and push notifications. The implementation will leverage Next.js PWA features, service workers, and web app manifest to provide a native app-like experience across mobile and desktop platforms.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Next.js 15.5.4, React 19.1.0  
**Primary Dependencies**: next-pwa, workbox-webpack-plugin, @types/serviceworker  
**Storage**: Browser Cache API, IndexedDB for offline data, existing PostgreSQL backend  
**Testing**: Playwright (existing), Jest for service worker testing  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers with PWA support (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)  
**Project Type**: Web application enhancement (single project)  
**Performance Goals**: 3s initial load, 1s cached load, <100ms interaction response  
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, responsive design, PWA audit score >90  
**Scale/Scope**: Existing user base, 10+ pages, offline-first architecture

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Gate 1: Feature Scope Clarity** ✅ PASS
- Clear user stories with measurable acceptance criteria
- Well-defined functional requirements
- Specific success criteria with metrics

**Gate 2: Technical Feasibility** ✅ PASS  
- Existing Next.js application provides solid foundation
- PWA standards are well-established and supported
- No complex integrations or external dependencies

**Gate 3: Implementation Complexity** ✅ PASS
- Single project enhancement (not multi-project)
- Leverages existing codebase and architecture
- Standard PWA patterns and libraries available

**Gate 4: Testing Strategy** ✅ PASS
- Existing Playwright test suite can be extended
- PWA functionality is testable with standard tools
- Clear acceptance scenarios defined

**Structure Decision**: Single project enhancement leveraging existing Next.js structure. PWA functionality integrated into current codebase with minimal structural changes. New PWA-specific files added alongside existing architecture.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
