# Implementation Plan: Build a web application for renter to help to see analytics about his rents.

**Branch**: `001-build-a-web` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: /Users/k05m0navt/Programming/PetProjects/Web/rentsight/specs/001-build-a-web/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-web/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a web application for renters to view and analyze their rental analytics, including income, booked days, platform-specific income, expenses, and the ability to tag and filter data. The application must also support data export in PDF, CSV, and Excel formats. The technical approach will leverage Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, ShadCN/UI, and Supabase for both data storage and authentication.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (latest stable)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (latest stable), React (latest stable), Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, ShadCN/UI
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
**Testing**: Jest/React Testing Library (for unit/component tests), Playwright (for end-to-end tests)
**Target Platform**: Web (modern browsers)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Renters can view their overall analytics dashboard within 3 seconds of login. Filtering analytics data by tags updates the display within 2 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 entries. Data export to PDF, CSV, or Excel completes within 10 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 entries.
**Constraints**: Secure login, clear messaging for no data scenarios, responsive handling of large data volumes.
**Scale/Scope**: Analytics for individual renters, supporting up to 10,000 entries per dataset for performance targets.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Code Quality**: PASSED. Next.js, TypeScript, and a component library like ShadCN/UI, combined with a clear code review process, will ensure high code quality.
- **II. Comprehensive Testing**: PASSED. The plan includes Jest/React Testing Library for unit/component tests and Playwright for end-to-end tests, aligning with the requirement for comprehensive automated testing.
- **III. Performance Optimization**: PASSED. The chosen stack (Next.js, Tailwind) is performant, and specific performance goals are defined in the Technical Context, which will be monitored and optimized.

prisma/                  # Prisma schema and migrations
```

**Structure Decision**: The project will use a monorepo structure with a `web` application under `apps/` for the Next.js frontend and API routes, and a `prisma/` directory for database schema and migrations. Shared UI components can be extracted to `packages/ui` if necessary in the future.
