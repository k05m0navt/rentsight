# Design Guidelines: Rentsight Analytics Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-web`  
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Overview

This document outlines the design principles and guidelines for the Rentsight Analytics web application to ensure a consistent, user-friendly, and responsive user interface across all features. The design will primarily leverage ShadCN/UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Core Principles

1.  **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent look, feel, and interaction model throughout the application. All UI elements, typography, colors, and spacing should adhere to established patterns.
2.  **Clarity & Simplicity**: Designs should be intuitive and easy to understand. Avoid unnecessary complexity and prioritize clear communication of information.
3.  **Responsiveness**: The application MUST be fully responsive and provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
4.  **Accessibility**: Adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities. This includes proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast.
5.  **Performance**: UI elements and interactions should be performant, ensuring smooth transitions, quick loading times, and a fluid user experience.

## UI Framework & Styling

-   **Component Library**: ShadCN/UI will be the primary component library. All components should be utilized as provided by ShadCN/UI, with minimal customization to maintain consistency and ease of maintenance.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS will be used for all custom styling. Direct CSS or inline styles should be avoided in favor of Tailwind utility classes.
-   **Color Palette**: Define a consistent color palette (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error, neutral) and apply it uniformly across the application.
-   **Typography**: Establish a clear typographic scale (font families, sizes, weights) for headings, body text, and other textual elements.
-   **Spacing**: Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., based on Tailwind's default spacing scale) for margins, paddings, and gaps between elements.

## Layout & Structure

-   **Page Layouts**: Establish consistent page layouts for main content areas, dashboards, forms, and analytical views. Consider common patterns like sidebars, headers, and footers.
-   **Navigation**: Implement clear and intuitive navigation patterns, ensuring users can easily move between different sections of the application.
-   **Data Visualization**: For analytics, use clear and appropriate data visualization techniques (charts, graphs, tables) that effectively communicate insights. Maintain consistency in chart types, colors, and labeling.

## Interaction Design

-   **Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear feedback to users for their actions (e.g., loading states, success messages, error notifications).
-   **Forms**: Design forms to be user-friendly with clear labels, validation messages, and efficient input methods.
-   **Filtering & Sorting**: Ensure filtering and sorting mechanisms are prominent, easy to use, and provide visual indicators of active filters.

## Iconography

-   Use a consistent icon library (e.g., Lucide Icons which are commonly used with ShadCN/UI) for all visual cues.
-   Maintain consistent sizing and styling for icons.

## Design Assets

-   Any specific design assets (logos, illustrations) will be provided separately and integrated according to these guidelines.
