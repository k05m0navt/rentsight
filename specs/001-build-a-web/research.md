# Research Findings: Build a web application for renter to help to see analytics about his rents.

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-web`  
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

No critical ambiguities or `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers were identified in the feature specification (`spec.md`). Therefore, no specific research was required to resolve outstanding questions or technical details for the initial planning phase. The technical stack and high-level architectural decisions were provided directly by the user, negating the need for further research into primary dependencies, storage, or authentication methods at this stage.

## Technical Context Research

**Decision**: No specific research tasks were generated as all `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` placeholders were resolved or deemed non-critical during the `/speckit.clarify` phase.

**Rationale**: The user provided a clear and concise description of the desired features and specified the entire technology stack, including Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma ORM, ShadCN/UI, and Supabase for data storage and authentication. This level of detail eliminated the need for exploratory research into these areas for the planning phase.

**Alternatives Considered**: N/A (user provided clear technology choices).

## Best Practices Research

**Decision**: General best practices for the chosen technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, Supabase) will be integrated into the implementation phase. Specific research for these best practices will be performed as part of individual development tasks rather than a dedicated pre-planning research phase.

**Rationale**: Given the maturity of the chosen technologies and the clear feature requirements, a dedicated pre-planning research phase for general best practices is not critical. Best practices will be applied incrementally during development and code review.

**Alternatives Considered**: A comprehensive best practices document could be generated, but this would add overhead without immediately contributing to the core planning. This approach is deferred to development tasks.

## Integration Patterns Research

**Decision**: Integration patterns for Supabase (authentication and database access) will follow official Supabase client library documentation and recommended Next.js integration patterns.

**Rationale**: Supabase provides well-documented client libraries and integration guides for Next.js, making extensive preliminary research into custom integration patterns unnecessary.

**Alternatives Considered**: Custom API layers or alternative database access methods were not considered due to the explicit choice of Prisma ORM and Supabase.
