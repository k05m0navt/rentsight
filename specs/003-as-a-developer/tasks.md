# Tasks: Complete Application Redesign

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-as-a-developer/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/design-system.md ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app with src/**: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/styles/`
- All paths shown below follow Next.js App Router structure from plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Foundation for all pages
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational + User Story 1 (uses navigation and UI primitives)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational + User Story 1 (uses navigation and UI primitives)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + User Story 1 (uses navigation and UI primitives)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: FOUNDATIONAL - Must complete first. Provides navigation and core UI primitives used by all other stories.
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on US1 for navigation and primitives. Can proceed once US1 complete.
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 for navigation and primitives. Can run in parallel with US2 if staffed.
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 for navigation and primitives. Can run in parallel with US2/US3 if staffed.

**Note**: While US2, US3, US4 depend on US1's primitives, they can proceed in parallel once US1 is complete if team capacity allows.

### Within Each User Story

- UI primitives (T013-T017) can run in parallel within US1
- Layout components (T018-T022) sequential within US1 (depend on primitives)
- Different page updates (T024-T026) can run in parallel within US1
- Dashboard components (T027-T031) can start in parallel within US2
- Form components (T036-T039) can run in parallel within US3
- Tag components (T044-T047) can run in parallel within US4

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All tasks (T001-T005) can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: T007, T008, T011 can run in parallel (different files)
- **US1 Primitives**: T013-T017 can all run in parallel (different component files)
- **US1 Pages**: T024-T026 can run in parallel (different page files)
- **US2 Components**: T027-T028 can run in parallel
- **US3 Components**: T036-T039 can run in parallel
- **US4 Components**: T044-T047 can run in parallel
- **Polish Testing**: T051-T056 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- **Polish Browser**: T057-T058 can run in parallel
- **Polish Responsive**: T060-T061 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Navigation Foundation)

```bash
# Launch all UI primitives together (Phase 3, Step 1):
Task: "Redesign src/components/ui/button.tsx with new variants"
Task: "Redesign src/components/ui/card.tsx with new styles"
Task: "Redesign src/components/ui/input.tsx with new border styles"
Task: "Redesign src/components/ui/badge.tsx with new colors"
Task: "Redesign src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx with new styles"

# Then launch page updates together (Phase 3, Step 3):
Task: "Update src/app/page.tsx landing page"
Task: "Update src/app/login/page.tsx authentication form"
Task: "Update src/app/signup/page.tsx registration form"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Analytics Dashboard)

```bash
# Launch dashboard components together:
Task: "Create src/components/dashboard/MetricsCard.tsx"
Task: "Create src/components/dashboard/ChartContainer.tsx"
Task: "Update src/app/dashboard/rent-analytics.tsx"
Task: "Update src/app/dashboard/expense-analytics.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí ~30 minutes
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational ‚Üí ~2 hours (design tokens, theme config)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Navigation) ‚Üí ~6 hours (primitives + navigation + pages)
4. **CHECKPOINT**: Validate navigation works, themes switch, all pages accessible
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Analytics) ‚Üí ~6 hours (dashboard + visualizations + performance)
6. **CHECKPOINT**: Validate analytics render with 10,000+ entries, charts use new colors
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test entire flow (login ‚Üí navigate ‚Üí view analytics)
8. Deploy/demo if ready (MVP with core navigation and analytics complete)

**MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 & 2 (both P1) = Fully navigable app with redesigned analytics

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (~2.5 hours)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test navigation independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~6 hours)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test analytics independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~6 hours)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test forms independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~4 hours)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test tag management independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~3 hours)
6. Add Polish ‚Üí Complete testing and QA ‚Üí **Final Deployment** (~8 hours)

**Total Estimated Time**: ~30 hours for complete redesign with all user stories and polish

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Day 1**: Entire team completes Setup + Foundational together (~2.5 hours)
2. **Day 1-2**: Once Foundational done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Navigation) - MUST complete first (~6 hours)
3. **Day 2-3**: Once US1 complete (primitives available):
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (Analytics) (~6 hours)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 (Forms) (~4 hours)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 4 (Tags) (~3 hours)
4. **Day 3-4**: Polish & Testing together (~8 hours)

**Parallel Benefit**: Reduces Days 2-3 from ~13 hours sequential to ~6 hours parallel

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 7 tasks ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKS all stories
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Navigation)**: 14 tasks üéØ MVP Foundation
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Analytics)**: 9 tasks üéØ MVP Core Value
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Forms)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Tags)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 22 tasks

**Total**: 72 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 32 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with others in their phase

**Critical Path**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US2/US3/US4 (parallel) ‚Üí Polish

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label (US1, US2, US3, US4) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **User Story 1 is FOUNDATIONAL**: Provides navigation and UI primitives for all other stories
- **Big Bang Deployment**: All user stories must complete before deployment (per spec clarification)
- Comprehensive testing in Phase 7 is critical for big bang deployment confidence
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- IE11 testing requires manual validation (BrowserStack or Windows VM)
- Visual regression tests require baseline creation on first run (`--update-snapshots`)
- Performance testing with 10,000+ entries requires test data seeding
- Commit after each task or logical group for easier rollback if needed

---
