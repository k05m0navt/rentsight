# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced UX/UI Experience

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification is written from user perspective, focusing on what users need and why. No specific technologies are mandated (e.g., "motion library" instead of "Framer Motion implementation"). All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and well-structured.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 42 functional requirements are specific and testable. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria use measurable metrics (percentages, time durations, completion rates). Edge cases cover key scenarios like concurrent access, rapid interactions, and timeout situations.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Each of the 10 user stories has clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format. Stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable. Success criteria align with user stories and focus on user outcomes rather than technical implementation.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All quality checks passed on first validation
- Feature is well-scoped with clear priorities
- Assumptions section properly documents reasonable defaults
- No clarifications needed from user
