## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12

- Q: When a user confirms deletion of a tag that's assigned to properties and entries, what should happen to those associations? → A: Automatically remove tag from all properties and entries, then delete tag
- Q: Where should the cached data be stored? → A: Hybrid: client-side for UI state, server-side for data queries
- Q: How should Russian translations be provided and maintained? → A: I do not need to translate the app, I just need to make some select fields for russian users, for example Russian Ruble currency, russian booking platforms and etc
- Q: Where should the theme toggle and authentication buttons be positioned in the sidebar? → A: At the bottom of sidebar, below all navigation items
- Q: What level of interactivity should the help page tutorials provide? → A: Simple: Links that open relevant app pages in new tab

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Sidebar Authentication Controls (Priority: P1)

Users need quick and intuitive access to authentication controls. The sidebar should display sign-in when unauthenticated and logout when authenticated, along with a theme toggle for personalization. These controls are positioned at the bottom of the sidebar below all navigation items for easy access without cluttering the main navigation.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is core to the app. Users need clear, accessible controls for logging in/out. This is foundational functionality that doesn't depend on other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing the sidebar while logged out (seeing sign-in button at bottom), logging in (seeing logout button at bottom), and toggling the theme. Delivers immediate value by improving navigation clarity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is not logged in, **When** user views the sidebar, **Then** a "Sign In" button is visible at the bottom of the sidebar below all navigation items
2. **Given** user is logged in, **When** user views the sidebar, **Then** a "Log Out" button is visible at the bottom of the sidebar below all navigation items
3. **Given** user is logged in, **When** user clicks the "Log Out" button, **Then** user is logged out and redirected to the login page
4. **Given** user is on any page, **When** user views the sidebar, **Then** a theme toggle control is visible at the bottom of the sidebar below all navigation items (not on dashboard page)
5. **Given** user clicks the theme toggle, **When** theme changes, **Then** the change is persisted across sessions

---

### User Story 2 - Skeleton Loading States (Priority: P1)

Users experience jarring blank screens while content loads. Replace loading text with skeleton screens that match the shape of the content being loaded, providing visual continuity and reducing perceived wait time.

**Why this priority**: Loading states affect every user interaction. Skeleton screens provide better perceived performance and reduce user frustration. This is a high-impact UX improvement that can be tested independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by throttling network speed and observing loading states on any page. Delivers value by making the app feel more responsive and professional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user navigates to dashboard, **When** data is loading, **Then** skeleton screens matching dashboard card layouts are displayed
2. **Given** user navigates to properties list, **When** properties are loading, **Then** skeleton screens matching property card layouts are displayed
3. **Given** user navigates to any data-driven page, **When** content is loading, **Then** skeleton screens are displayed instead of text like "Loading..."
4. **Given** skeleton screens are displayed, **When** data finishes loading, **Then** skeletons smoothly transition to actual content
5. **Given** slow network conditions, **When** user navigates between pages, **Then** skeleton screens provide immediate visual feedback

---

### User Story 3 - Tag Deletion Fix (Priority: P1)

Users encounter errors when attempting to delete tags. The system should reliably delete tags, handle edge cases (tags in use), and provide clear feedback about the deletion status.

**Why this priority**: This is a bug fix that prevents users from managing their tags effectively. It blocks core functionality and should be addressed immediately.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating tags, attempting to delete them, and verifying deletion with various scenarios (unused tags, tags assigned to properties/entries). Delivers value by restoring critical functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has a tag that is not assigned to any entries or properties, **When** user clicks delete on that tag, **Then** the tag is successfully deleted immediately
2. **Given** user has a tag assigned to entries/properties, **When** user attempts to delete that tag, **Then** user is warned showing count of affected items (e.g., "This tag is used by 5 properties and 12 entries") and asked to confirm deletion
3. **Given** user confirms tag deletion with associations, **When** deletion proceeds, **Then** the tag is automatically removed from all associated properties and entries, then deleted permanently
4. **Given** a tag deletion fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** user sees a clear error message explaining what went wrong
5. **Given** user deletes a tag successfully, **When** deletion completes, **Then** user sees a success confirmation indicating the tag and all associations were removed, and the tag list updates immediately

---

### User Story 4 - Enhanced Light Mode Design (Priority: P2)

Users report that light mode doesn't look polished. The light theme should use proper contrast ratios, readable colors, appropriate shadows, and visual hierarchy to create a beautiful, professional appearance.

**Why this priority**: Many users prefer light mode during daytime. A poorly designed light mode affects user experience and perception of quality. This can be developed independently of other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by switching to light mode and evaluating all pages for readability, contrast, and visual appeal. Delivers value by making the app usable for light mode users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user switches to light mode, **When** viewing any page, **Then** all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text)
2. **Given** user is in light mode, **When** viewing cards and containers, **Then** subtle shadows and borders create clear visual hierarchy
3. **Given** user is in light mode, **When** viewing buttons and interactive elements, **Then** colors are vibrant and clearly indicate interactivity
4. **Given** user is in light mode, **When** viewing the entire application, **Then** the color palette is cohesive and professional
5. **Given** user switches between light and dark mode, **When** theme changes, **Then** all components transition smoothly and maintain visual consistency

---

### User Story 5 - Smooth Animations with Motion Library (Priority: P2)

Users experience abrupt interface changes. Add smooth, purposeful animations to page transitions, component appearances, and interactive elements to create a fluid, modern user experience.

**Why this priority**: Animations significantly enhance perceived quality and user delight. While not blocking functionality, they greatly improve the overall experience. This can be implemented incrementally.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interacting with various UI elements and observing smooth transitions. Delivers value by making the app feel more polished and responsive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user navigates between pages, **When** page transitions occur, **Then** content fades in smoothly over 200-300ms
2. **Given** user opens modals or dialogs, **When** modal appears, **Then** it scales in with a subtle animation
3. **Given** user hovers over cards or buttons, **When** hover state activates, **Then** elements smoothly scale or highlight
4. **Given** user adds/removes items from lists, **When** list updates, **Then** items animate in/out with stagger effect
5. **Given** user interacts with any animated element, **When** animation runs, **Then** animation feels natural and doesn't slow down interactions
6. **Given** user has motion sensitivity preferences, **When** system detects reduced motion preference, **Then** animations are minimized or disabled

---

### User Story 6 - Improved Color Usage (Priority: P2)

Users notice inconsistent and improper use of colors across the application. Establish and apply a systematic color system with semantic meanings (primary, success, warning, error) used consistently across all components.

**Why this priority**: Color consistency is crucial for usability and professionalism. Poor color usage confuses users about what actions do. This improves overall coherence.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by auditing all UI components for color usage patterns and verifying semantic consistency. Delivers value by making the interface more intuitive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user views action buttons, **When** comparing similar actions, **Then** similar actions use the same color scheme
2. **Given** user sees destructive actions (delete), **When** viewing these controls, **Then** they consistently use error/warning colors
3. **Given** user views success messages, **When** operations complete successfully, **Then** success color is used consistently
4. **Given** user interacts with primary actions, **When** viewing these buttons, **Then** primary brand color is used consistently
5. **Given** user views muted/secondary content, **When** viewing labels and descriptions, **Then** muted colors are used appropriately
6. **Given** user views the entire interface, **When** analyzing color usage, **Then** no more than 3-4 semantic colors are used for interactions

---

### User Story 7 - Depth and Visual Realism (Priority: P2)

Users describe the interface as "flat" and lacking depth. Introduce subtle shadows, layering, elevation levels, and depth cues to create a more realistic, engaging interface that guides user attention.

**Why this priority**: Visual depth improves information hierarchy and makes interfaces easier to scan. This enhances usability without changing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing before/after screenshots and user feedback on visual clarity. Delivers value by making the interface easier to navigate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user views cards on any page, **When** viewing resting state, **Then** cards have subtle shadows indicating elevation
2. **Given** user hovers over interactive cards, **When** hover state activates, **Then** shadow depth increases to indicate interactivity
3. **Given** user views modals and overlays, **When** these appear, **Then** they have stronger shadows indicating higher elevation
4. **Given** user views the page hierarchy, **When** scanning the layout, **Then** layering makes it clear what elements are containers vs content
5. **Given** user views the sidebar, **When** comparing with main content, **Then** sidebar has appropriate elevation separation
6. **Given** user views inputs and form fields, **When** fields are focused, **Then** elevation changes subtly indicate active state

---

### User Story 8 - Performance Optimization with Caching (Priority: P3)

Users experience delays when revisiting pages with data they've already loaded. Implement smart caching strategies to store frequently accessed data, reducing load times and improving perceived performance.

**Why this priority**: Performance improvements are valuable but don't directly affect functionality. Caching can be implemented incrementally and tested independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring page load times on repeat visits and monitoring network requests. Delivers value by making the app faster for returning users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user loads dashboard data, **When** user navigates away and returns within 5 minutes, **Then** cached data is displayed instantly from appropriate cache layer (UI state from client, query results from server)
2. **Given** user views properties list, **When** user revisits the page, **Then** previously loaded properties appear immediately from client cache while fresh data loads in background from server
3. **Given** user has cached data, **When** underlying data changes, **Then** both client and server caches are invalidated and fresh data is fetched
4. **Given** user performs a write operation (create/update/delete), **When** operation completes, **Then** related cached data in both client and server layers is invalidated
5. **Given** user navigates the app, **When** cache is used, **Then** stale data is never shown for more than 5 minutes regardless of cache layer
6. **Given** user's cache is full, **When** new data needs to be cached, **Then** oldest/least used data is evicted from respective cache layers

---

### User Story 9 - Enhanced Help Page Experience (Priority: P3)

Users find the help page basic and not particularly helpful. Enhance the help experience with searchable documentation, categorized help sections, easy access to support, and direct links to relevant app pages for hands-on learning.

**Why this priority**: While help content is important, most users don't visit help pages frequently. This can be enhanced iteratively without blocking other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating the help page and evaluating content quality, organization, and usefulness. Delivers value by improving self-service support.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user visits help page, **When** page loads, **Then** help content is organized into clear categories (Getting Started, Features, Troubleshooting, etc.)
2. **Given** user searches for help, **When** user types a query, **Then** relevant articles and FAQs are shown with highlighted matching text
3. **Given** user views a help article, **When** article displays, **Then** it includes step-by-step instructions with screenshots or illustrations
4. **Given** user needs more help, **When** viewing help page, **Then** clear contact options and support channels are prominently displayed
5. **Given** user is reading a tutorial, **When** tutorial references a feature, **Then** clickable links open relevant app pages in new tabs for hands-on practice
6. **Given** user browses FAQs, **When** clicking a question, **Then** answer expands smoothly with relevant links to detailed articles and app pages

---

### User Story 10 - Russian Market Options (Priority: P3)

Users from Russia need region-specific options including Russian Ruble currency, Russian booking platforms, and appropriate formatting. The application should provide Russian-specific select options and settings without requiring full UI translation.

**Why this priority**: Regional options are important for Russian users but don't require full internationalization. This can be implemented as a separate, testable feature focusing on practical regional needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding properties with Russian currency, selecting Russian platforms, and verifying proper formatting and options are available. Delivers value by making the app practical for Russian market users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is creating or editing a property, **When** selecting currency, **Then** Russian Ruble (RUB/₽) is available as a currency option
2. **Given** user is tracking properties from Russian platforms, **When** selecting source/platform, **Then** Russian booking platforms (Avito, CIAN, Domclick, Yandex.Realty) are available in dropdown
3. **Given** user selects Russian Ruble as currency, **When** viewing amounts, **Then** numbers are formatted with space as thousands separator (e.g., "50 000 ₽")
4. **Given** user is viewing dates for Russian market properties, **When** dates are displayed, **Then** dates can optionally use DD.MM.YYYY format
5. **Given** user saves regional preferences (currency, platforms), **When** user returns, **Then** preferences are persisted across sessions
6. **Given** user needs help with Russian market features, **When** viewing help page, **Then** documentation explains Russian-specific options and platforms

### Edge Cases

- What happens when animations are playing and user navigates away?
  - Animations should be cancelled/completed gracefully without errors
  
- What happens when cache becomes stale during a user session?
  - System should detect staleness and refresh data with visual indicator
  
- What happens when attempting to delete a tag that's being used in an active session?
  - System should handle concurrent access and show appropriate errors if needed
  
- What happens when user switches theme while animations are running?
  - Theme transition should complete smoothly without animation conflicts
  
- What happens when skeleton loading takes longer than expected?
  - After a timeout (e.g., 10 seconds), show a message offering to refresh or contact support
  
- What happens when user changes currency or date format preference with cached data?
  - Regional preference changes should invalidate relevant cache entries to reflect new formatting
  
- What happens when user has reduced motion preferences but animations are present?
  - System should respect prefers-reduced-motion and disable/minimize animations
  
- What happens when user rapidly toggles theme multiple times?
  - System should debounce theme changes and handle rapid switches gracefully

- **User Preference**: Stores user-specific settings including theme (light/dark), motion preferences, currency preference (USD, EUR, RUB, etc.), date format preference (MM/DD/YYYY or DD.MM.YYYY), preferred platforms, and last selected values. Persisted across sessions.

- **Cache Entry**: Represents cached data in hybrid architecture. Client-side entries store UI state (preferences, view states, navigation context) in browser storage. Server-side entries store query results (dashboard data, property lists, aggregations) in server memory. Both include metadata: key, value, timestamp, expiration time, and staleness indicators. Used for performance optimization across application layers.

- **Tag**: Existing entity that requires enhanced deletion logic to handle associations with properties and entries. Includes validation and cascade deletion rules.

- **Help Article**: Structured documentation with category, title, content, searchable text, and related articles. Supports search and filtering.

- **Regional Option**: Configuration for region-specific features including currency symbols and codes (RUB/₽, USD/$, EUR/€), platform lists (Russian platforms: Avito, CIAN, Domclick, Yandex.Realty; US platforms: Zillow, Trulia, etc.), and formatting rules (number separators, date formats).

## Assumptions

1. **Framer Motion Library**: We assume Framer Motion is the preferred animation library based on user request. This choice provides production-ready animations with accessibility support built-in.

2. **Cache Strategy**: We assume a 5-minute cache expiration is appropriate for financial data (rent/expense entries) to balance freshness with performance. Users will tolerate slightly stale data for better speed.

3. **Tag Deletion Error**: We assume the current error is related to missing cascade deletion logic or improper error handling, not database-level constraints.

4. **Russian Market Support**: We assume Russian users need practical regional options (currency, platforms, formatting) rather than full UI translation. This focuses on functionality over localization.

5. **Light Mode Issues**: We assume light mode issues are primarily related to insufficient contrast and improper color mappings rather than fundamental design flaws.

6. **Animation Tolerance**: We assume users expect modern, smooth animations but will benefit from respecting accessibility preferences (prefers-reduced-motion).

7. **Help Content Exists**: We assume help article content exists or can be written. The specification focuses on the presentation, discovery mechanisms, and simple linking to app pages for hands-on learning.

8. **Sidebar Space**: We assume there is sufficient space in the sidebar to accommodate theme toggle, authentication buttons, and existing navigation without overwhelming the interface.

9. **Browser Support**: We assume modern browser support (last 2 versions of major browsers) for animation libraries and caching strategies.

10. **Performance Baseline**: We assume current loading states show simple text ("Loading...") and provide no visual continuity, making skeleton screens a clear improvement.
