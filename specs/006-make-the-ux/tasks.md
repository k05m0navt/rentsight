# Tasks: Enhanced UX/UI Experience

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-make-the-ux/`  
**Branch**: `006-make-the-ux`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: ‚úÖ Tests INCLUDED - This feature uses TDD with Playwright E2E tests per acceptance criteria

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (10 stories total) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US10)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Next.js web app: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `tests/`
- All paths relative to repository root

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Stories (Phases 3-12)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - P1 stories (US1-US3) should complete first (critical fixes)
  - P2 stories (US4-US7) can proceed in parallel after P1 or sequentially
  - P3 stories (US8-US10) can proceed in parallel after P2 or sequentially
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

All user stories are designed to be independently testable:

- **US1 - Sidebar Auth**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational
- **US2 - Skeleton Loading**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational
- **US3 - Tag Deletion**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational
- **US4 - Light Mode**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational
- **US5 - Animations**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational
- **US6 - Color Usage**: Recommended after US4 (Light Mode) for color consistency
- **US7 - Elevation**: Can work with US4, US6 but independently testable
- **US8 - Caching**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational
- **US9 - Help Page**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational
- **US10 - Russian Market**: No dependencies, can start after Foundational

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Components marked [P] can be built in parallel
- Services depend on models
- UI depends on services/APIs
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All 4 tasks can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: T008, T009, T010, T011, T012 can run in parallel
- **Test Phase**: All tests within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Implementation Phase**: All tasks marked [P] within a story can run in parallel
- **User Stories**: Once Foundational complete, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Skeleton Loading)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together (TDD):
Task T026: E2E test for dashboard skeleton
Task T027: E2E test for properties skeleton
Task T028: E2E test for layout matching
Task T029: E2E test for smooth transition
Task T030: E2E test for immediate appearance

# Launch all skeleton components together:
Task T031: Base skeleton component
Task T032: SkeletonCard component
Task T033: SkeletonTable component
Task T034: SkeletonText component

# Launch page-specific skeletons together:
Task T035: DashboardSkeleton
Task T037: PropertyListSkeleton
Task T039: RentEntrySkeleton
Task T041: ExpenseEntrySkeleton
Task T043: TagListSkeleton
Task T045: ReportsSkeleton
```

| 12 | US10: Russian Market | P3 | 20 | 6 | 14 |
| 13 | Polish | - | 15 | 0 | 15 |
| **Total** | | | **192** | **51** | **141** |

**Breakdown**:
- **P1 (Critical)**: 46 tasks (24% of total)
- **P2 (High Impact)**: 63 tasks (33% of total)
- **P3 (Enhancement)**: 53 tasks (28% of total)
- **Infrastructure**: 30 tasks (15% of total)

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-5 (Setup + Foundational + US1-US3) = 61 tasks

**Note on Terminology**: The spec.md uses "motion library" (technology-agnostic) while tasks.md specifies "Framer Motion" (concrete implementation). This is intentional - specifications remain technology-agnostic while implementation plans are specific.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label (US1-US10) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests written FIRST (TDD approach) - they should FAIL before implementation
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at checkpoints to validate story independence
- 50 E2E tests total (~5 per user story) covering all acceptance criteria
- All file paths are relative to repository root
