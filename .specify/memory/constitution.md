# Rentsight Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code MUST adhere to established code quality standards, including readability, maintainability, and best practices. Code MUST be reviewed and approved before merging.

### II. Comprehensive Testing
All critical functionality MUST be covered by automated tests. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests MUST be implemented to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. New features and bug fixes MUST include corresponding tests.

### III. Performance Optimization
The project MUST be optimized for best performance metrics, including load times, responsiveness, and resource utilization. Performance budgets MUST be defined and monitored. Regular performance profiling and optimization efforts MUST be undertaken.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles.
